A comment on the justification for licensing under both the AGPL-3.0+ and the 
Apache-2.0 in combination.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within Australian courts if there is any ambiguity in exclusion clauses they 
will be interpreted narrowly. If liability for negligence is not expressly 
excluded it may not be read as excluded within an Australian court 
(https://eprints.qut.edu.au/7404/1/open_source_book.pdf page 80). 
The same is true for clauses which seek to exclude liability for consequential 
loss.

The AGPL-3.0 does not explicitly mention negligence anywhere within its licence
text.

By combining the Apache-2.0 licence and the AGPL-3.0+ licence these 
requirements of Australian Law can be addressed as well as taking advantage of 
the strict copy-left of the AGPL-3.0+ licence.

All code here is licenced under both the AGPL-3.0+ AND the Apache-2.0 licence.
Your use and copying of this code is under the terms of BOTH of these licences,
simultaneously, in combination.

Their respective licences are found within the AGPL-3.0+ and Apache-2.0 files.
